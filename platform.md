### Overview of ClearView Platform

The ClearView solution requires a user-facing application optimized for both mobile and web interfaces to efficiently handle user interactions and various functional activities. It focuses primarily on CRUD operations, including managing candidate profiles, resumes, job listings, viewing job matches, and collecting data for reporting. This emphasizes the need for a simple, maintainable, and efficient application architecture.

Given the constraints of business operating in the charity sector, we chose cost-effectiveness as a key concern. Additionally, to validate the business idea quickly, time-to-market is critical.

The platform must also be able to scale over time, allowing more hiring companies and candidates to participate in diversity-inclusive hiring programs. To meet these objectives, we propose implementing a modular monolithic architecture for this application.

This modular approach ensures clear separation of responsibilities, enabling easier development, maintenance, and future scaling of the platform.

### Driving Factors

The following components have been identified as critical for the platform's functional operations. Each of these components will be developed as part of the modular monolith:

* **Authentication and Authorization**:
Manages user login, registration, and access controls. Ensures security and role-based access across different user types (candidates, companies, administrators).

* **Candidate Management**:
Handles CRUD operations for candidate profiles, allowing candidates to manage their details, resumes, and job applications.

* **Resume Manager**:
Provides resume upload, parsing, and enhancement capabilities, interacting closely with the AI engine for resume analysis.

* **Company Management**:
Manages company profiles and their participation in job postings, particularly those aligned with diversity and inclusion initiatives.

* **Job Manager**:
Responsible for creating, updating, and managing job postings, allowing companies to list opportunities and manage applications.

* **AIConnector**:
Connects the user interface with the ClearView AI engine, facilitating AI-driven functionalities such as candidate matching, talent scoring, and profile anonymization.

* **Survey & Feedback Management**:
Manages surveys and feedback collection from candidates and companies, providing insight into the platformâ€™s effectiveness.

* **Notifications**:
Handles email and in-app notifications for various activities such as job application updates, new job postings, and feedback requests.

* **External Integration**:
Facilitates integration with external systems, such as job boards, applicant tracking systems (ATS), and social media platforms.

* **ClearView Administrator Management**:
Provides administrative functionalities for managing the platform, overseeing users, jobs, and data analytics.

* **Data & Analytics**:
Captures and reports key metrics related to system performance, user behavior, and business intelligence for better decision-making.

* **Billing & Payment Module**:
Handles billing, invoicing, and payment processing for companies using the platform's premium services.

#### Key Software Architecture Characteristics

    Cost-effectiveness:
        The modular monolith design is proposed to minimize infrastructure complexity and initial costs. By avoiding the overhead of distributed systems in the early stages, development and operational costs can be kept low.
        The monolithic architecture allows faster development cycles and fewer dependencies compared to microservices, making it a suitable choice given the budget constraints.

    Time-to-Market:
        The monolith allows for quicker deployment as all components are developed and deployed as a single unit. This eliminates the complexity of managing multiple services, enabling faster testing and market validation.

    Modularity:
        While the application is structured as a monolith, its design will follow a modular approach, where each functional area is encapsulated in its own module. This ensures code organization, maintainability, and easier future transitions to microservices if required.

    Scalability (Future Growth):
        The modular monolith approach allows the platform to scale horizontally in the future by splitting specific modules into microservices as the system grows. This flexibility ensures that scaling efforts can be introduced incrementally, aligning with the growing demand.
        As the platform expands, specific high-traffic modules (e.g., Candidate Management) can be isolated and scaled independently.
