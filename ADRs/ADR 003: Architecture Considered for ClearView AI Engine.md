# Title
Microservices Architecture for ClearView AI Engine

## Status
Superseded by [ADR #002](ADR%20002%3A%20Architecture%20Decision%20for%20ClearView%20AI%20Engine.md)

## Context
The ClearView AI engine was initially proposed to be designed using a microservices architecture. Each AI function, such as Resume Enhancer, Talent Match Score, and Company Profile Finder, would be implemented as an independent service. The goal was to allow each component to scale independently, and provide a clear separation of concerns.

**Decision**:  
We decided to structure the ClearView AI engine using microservices, where each key function (Resume Enhancer, Candidate Matching, AI Connector, etc.) operates as a standalone service. These services communicate through APIs, and they are managed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Consequences
* **Pros**:
  * Independent scalability of services.
  * Easier to manage and deploy updates to individual services without affecting the entire system.

* **Cons**:
  * Increased complexity in managing multiple services.
  * Difficulties with inter-service communication and coordination.
  * Overhead in terms of operational and infrastructure management, including monitoring, scaling, and securing multiple services.
