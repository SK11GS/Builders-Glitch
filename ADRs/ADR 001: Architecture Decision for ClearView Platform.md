# Modular Monolith Architecture for ClearView Platform

## Status
Proposed

## Context 
The ClearView platform needs to handle increasing business demands as more companies and candidates join the diversity of inclusion programs. 
Initially, the platform is expected to manage moderate user traffic and CRUD operations, but it must be designed with the ability to scale in the future as the user base grows. Scalability is a critical factor, given that the system may need to support significantly larger volumes of candidate profiles, resumes, and job listings over time. Additionally, operating within a cost-effective framework is important due to budget constraints, and time-to-market is a priority to validate the platform in its initial phase.

## Decision
The ClearView platform will adopt a **modular monolith** architecture for the initial phase, which is both cost-effective and allows for quick time-to-market. This approach will enable clear separation of responsibilities within the system while allowing it to scale over time. The modular monolith design also enables a smoother future transition to microservices, should the need arise to scale components independently.

Key scalability mechanisms include:
- **Horizontal scaling**: The ability to add more application instances to handle increased traffic.
- **Queue-based processing**: For asynchronous tasks such as handling background jobs or AI-driven data processing.

## Consequences
* **Short-term**: The modular monolith architecture allows for fast development, reduced complexity, and cost savings while supporting scalability through horizontal scaling. This ensures the system can handle increasing load as it gains users without immediate re-architecture.

* **Long-term**: As user demand increases, the system will need to gradually adopt a microservices approach for scalability. This transition, while possible, may require additional development time and resources to decouple services and manage the increased operational complexity of microservices.

* **Performance optimization**: In the short term, scaling will rely on adding more instances of the monolithic application. As the system grows, more granular scaling will be possible by isolating critical components into microservices.
