# Title 
Event-Driven Architecture for ClearView AI Engine

## Status
Proposed

## Context  
The ClearView AI engine is a critical part of the platform, handling all AI operations such as candidate matching, resume enhancement, and generating talent scores. 
As the platform scales and AI demands grow, the architecture must support efficient processing of large datasets, AI model computations, and the ability to adapt to rapid advancements in AI technology. Additionally, the system needs to handle asynchronous operations, such as batch processing of resumes and job postings, while also providing real-time responses for certain user interactions with resume enhancer and company profile finder.

ClearView’s AI engine must be available, scalable, and capable of evolving with new AI advancements. 
Two primary architectural options under consideration are **Microservices Architecture** and **Event-Driven Architecture**. Both approaches offer support for the chosen characteristics but they differ in how they handle service interactions and asynchronous workflows.

**Decision**:  
The ClearView AI engine will adopt an **Event-Driven Architecture** with modular components. This design allows the system to handle asynchronous tasks, scale independently, and integrate with new AI services as they emerge.

**Key Differences**:
- **Microservices Architecture**:
    - **Description**: In a microservices architecture, each functionality of the AI engine (e.g., Resume Enhancer, Talent Match Score, Company Profile Finder) is deployed as an independent service. These services communicate via APIs and can be scaled independently based on demand.
    - **Advantages**:
        - Independent scaling of services.
        - Clear separation of concerns between different AI components.
        - Greater flexibility in choosing technology stacks for each service.
    - **Challenges**:
        - Increased operational complexity with managing multiple services.
        - Higher development and deployment overhead.
        - Requires sophisticated monitoring and inter-service communication mechanisms.

- **Event-Driven Architecture**:
    - **Description**: In an event-driven architecture, the system uses events to trigger AI processes. Each AI component subscribes to specific events (e.g., "Resume Uploaded", "Job Posted"), and the components perform their operations asynchronously. This architecture naturally fits with AI workloads that involve batch processing and model computations, which don’t always require immediate user feedback.
    - **Advantages**:
        - Efficient handling of asynchronous tasks.
        - Improved scalability and decoupling, as components respond to events and are not tightly coupled to other services.
        - Reduced latency for real-time tasks by triggering them only when needed.
    - **Challenges**:
        - Requires robust event orchestration and monitoring to ensure tasks are completed reliably.
        - Increased complexity in debugging and tracing event flows.
        - Requires careful design to avoid bottlenecks if certain services need to process a high volume of events.

**Consequences**:
- **Short-term**: The event-driven architecture enables the ClearView AI engine to handle both real-time and batch AI processes efficiently. This approach simplifies the handling of asynchronous tasks, such as batch processing of resumes or talent scoring, while ensuring responsiveness for real-time components like the Resume Enhancer. 

- **Long-term**: As the platform scales, the event-driven approach will ensure high flexibility and scalability, allowing individual components of the AI engine to be updated or replaced without significant disruption. However, it will require strong event management and monitoring systems to avoid performance bottlenecks and ensure the integrity of event flows.
