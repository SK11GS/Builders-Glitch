### Challenges & Assumptions
* The SMART profile story is generated by comparing anonymized resumes with job postings. This process occurs for every suitable job match.
* Candidates are limited to uploading a single resume to their profile.
* The queuing system is designed to be vendor-agnostic, allowing implementers to select solutions based on their specific needs and constraints.

### Out of Scope
* The current scope does not consider the in-app scheduling of DEI consultants and invoicing for their inclusion in the interview process.
* The current scope does not include in-app scheduling of interviews between candidates, hiring managers, and DEI consultants. 
* In-app interaction or chat options between candidates and hiring managers are not considered in the current scope, though these features may be considered in the future.

### Future Vision
* Candidates can upload and manage multiple versions of their resumes under a single profile.
* Suppose a hiring manager creates multiple job profiles, and a candidateâ€™s resume matches more than one. In that case, the system will notify the hiring manager that the resume has already been reviewed, preventing duplicate charges.
* Currently, the system matches candidates to jobs with a Talent Match Score of 80%, but future versions will allow hiring managers to customize these matching parameters.
* In the future, the ClearView solution may incorporate an AI-based DEI model to monitor interviews and analyze hiring bias, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution.
