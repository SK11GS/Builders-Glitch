To ensure optimal system scalability and evolvability, we have chosen to deploy Kubernetes on cloud infrastructure, leveraging its robust orchestration capabilities to efficiently manage and scale our application. One of the key advantages of Kubernetes is its powerful auto-scaling capabilities, allowing the system to dynamically adjust resource allocation in response to fluctuating demand. This ensures our application efficiently handles varying workloads while minimizing resource waste.
