To ensure optimal system scalability and evolvability, we have chosen to deploy Kubernetes on cloud infrastructure, leveraging its robust orchestration capabilities to efficiently manage and scale our application. One of the key advantages of Kubernetes is its powerful auto-scaling capabilities, allowing the system to dynamically adjust resource allocation in response to fluctuating demand. This ensures our application efficiently handles varying workloads while minimizing resource waste. This is a critical requirement, as DCC operates as a non-profit organization, making a cost-effective solution essential to meet our financial constraints while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Notes

The Messaging namespace and ClearView AI engine are currently illustrated as part of the Kubernetes deployment; however, this configuration can be adjusted in future phases to exclude them and integrate external services if required.
