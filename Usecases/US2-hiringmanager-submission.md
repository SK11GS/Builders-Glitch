### Sequence diagram description

A hiring manager submits their job request through the Job Manager module. 

The uploaded job request is then sent to the Job AI module, which analyzes the content and offers helpful suggestions for improvement.

The hiring manager can choose to either accept the suggestions or make their own edits before resubmitting the job request. This process can be repeated until the hiring manager is satisfied with the final version.

The hiring manager can submit their job request to the Match AI once they are satisfied with the final version.
